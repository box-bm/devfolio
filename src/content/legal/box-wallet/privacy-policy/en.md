# Privacy Policy for BoxWallet

## Overview

BoxWallet is a personal finance management app that prioritizes your privacy. All financial data — including transactions, loans, categories, and reports — is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.

## Data Collection

**BoxWallet does not collect, transmit, or share any of your financial data.** All transaction, loan, category, and report data is stored exclusively in a local database on your device.

However, BoxWallet uses **Google Firebase** to collect anonymous usage and diagnostic data in order to improve app stability and performance. This includes:

- **Crash reports:** Automatically sent when the app encounters an unexpected error, helping us identify and fix issues.
- **Usage analytics:** Anonymous, aggregated data about how features are used (e.g., which screens are visited). This data does not include any financial information.

This data is collected by Google Firebase and is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). You can learn more about how Firebase handles data at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com).

## Biometric Authentication

BoxWallet supports optional biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) to lock the app. Biometric data is handled entirely by the Android operating system and is never accessed or stored by BoxWallet.

## Google Drive Backup

BoxWallet offers an optional, user-initiated backup feature using Google Drive. When you choose to back up your data:

- Your financial data is exported and uploaded to your personal Google Drive account
- This process only occurs when you explicitly initiate it
- BoxWallet does not access any other files in your Google Drive
- You can restore your data from Google Drive at any time
- No financial data is sent to any server other than your own Google Drive account

## Third-Party Data Sharing

BoxWallet does **not** sell or share your financial data with third parties. The only third-party service used is Google Firebase, limited to anonymous crash reporting and usage analytics as described above.

## Permissions

BoxWallet requests the following Android permissions:

| Permission        | Purpose                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internet**      | Required for Google Drive backup/restore and Firebase analytics |
| **Biometric**     | Optional app lock using fingerprint or face recognition         |
| **Notifications** | Transaction reminders and scheduled alerts                      |
| **Storage**       | Exporting reports (PDF/Excel) to device storage                 |
| **Exact Alarms**  | Scheduling precise reminder notifications                       |

## Data Deletion

Since all financial data is stored locally on your device, you can delete it at any time through the app's **Settings > Data Management**. Uninstalling the app will also remove all local data.

Anonymous analytics and crash data collected by Firebase is managed by Google and is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in this document with an updated version number and effective date.
