# Privacy Policy for BoxWallet

## Overview

BoxWallet is a personal finance management app that prioritizes your privacy. All financial data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.

## Data Collection

**BoxWallet does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.** All transaction, loan, and category data is stored exclusively in a local database on your device.

## Biometric Authentication

BoxWallet supports optional biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) to lock the app. Biometric data is handled entirely by the Android operating system and is never accessed or stored by BoxWallet.

## Google Drive Backup

BoxWallet offers an optional, user-initiated backup feature using Google Drive. When you choose to back up your data:

- Your financial data is exported and uploaded to your personal Google Drive account
- This process only occurs when you explicitly initiate it
- BoxWallet does not access any other files in your Google Drive
- You can restore your data from Google Drive at any time
- No data is sent to any server other than your own Google Drive account

## Analytics and Tracking

BoxWallet does **not** use any analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks. No usage data is collected.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

BoxWallet does **not** share any data with third parties.

## Permissions

BoxWallet requests the following Android permissions:
